# Drug susceptibility collection

The purpose of this repository and the snakemake pipeline associated with it is
to regenerate the whole collection of transcriptomics signatures.

This collection is currently featured at the following BU's tools:

1. Beyondcell


This documentation aims to:

1. Document the whole rationale behind the generation of the signatures, including
why certain decisions were made.

2. Guide a potential along the configuration so that they can run the whole pipeline
again.

3. Serve as an example of how to code, distribute and document a workflow whose
potential uses span more than one project.
